 ## About_Author
 Written by Eder Martinez, using multiple resources (which are cited at the bottom). 

 ## Overview
 This is a simple game, in Pygame is used to create a side scrolling game. The player starts with 100% life which goes down when being touched by an enemy.
 PLEASE USE V 0_0_5 WHICH IS THE LATEST AND CLEANEST VERSION

 ## Known_Issues
 There is a small issues with the gravity at times, some of the people who tested my game thought it was a bit weird.

 ## Works_Cited
 This was one of the first projects I did, which means there was a lot of help. From forums on Stack Overflow to fix small issues of syntax to reading a whole book. The most prominent help came from the following
 - Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes: Specifically the Pygame project
 - The ultimate Introducton to Pygame by Clear Code: Specifically knowing the in and outs of pygame and how it works
 The biggest help was the Python Crash Course book, which I read almost from cover to cover.
